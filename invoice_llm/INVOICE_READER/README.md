With Gemini vision pro API from Google studio,  built a simple streamlit app that reads the invoice in the form of images. 

Note that the default behaviour of the model is set to read invoices only.

If you want you can change it's behaviour then add your own text under behaviour variable in app.py  

For example : if you want the model to get the ingredients of a dish in an image , simply edit the behaviour variable.

Don't forget to get the API from google studio and create  .env file in the project folder to store the api so that app.py takes the api from env file. 

Install the requirements in your local machine to run the app. 

Thank you.
